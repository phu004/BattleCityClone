# BattleCityClone
The goal of this project is to create a clone of the famous Battle City (NES) game. 2 Players can play together through TCP/IP connection. 

### How to run the game: ###

For windows user, download the compile game [here](https://github.com/phu004/test/blob/master/test/BattleTank.zip?raw=true). After unpacking, click on both runServer.bat and runClient.bat. On the server frame window, clikc on the "create server" button. On the client window, first specify the ip address of the server and then click on the "connect server" button. (if you leave the ip field bank, it will assume that you both server and client are running on the same computer). The windows version of  the game comes with its own JRE, so you don't even need to have Java installed.

For non-windows user, you will need to have Java installed. Download the same game package as above, but start the server and client with CLI commands:
"java ServerView.java"  and "java ClientView.java".
